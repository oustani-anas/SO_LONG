Welcome to my basic computer graphics project created as part of my school coursework! In this project, I've utilized the MiniLibX library to develop a graphical application that explores various fundamental concepts in computer graphics, including window management, event handling, colors, and textures. This project not only enhances my programming skills but also serves as a platform to demonstrate my proficiency in C programming, algorithmic thinking, and research capabilities.
